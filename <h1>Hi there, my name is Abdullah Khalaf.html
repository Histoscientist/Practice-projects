<h1>Hi there, my name is Abdullah Khalaf, and I'll be using this page to showcase complex HTML skills in the future as I continue to learn</h1>
<br>
<h3>Such</h3>

<h2>So first off, I just want to preface that sara is annoying.</h2>
<h1>Now that that's been established, I want to talk about elements and tags in HTML. The most basic is h1 to h6. 
    These help you make headers of varying sizes, with h1 being the largest and h6 being the smallest.
<br> The second is... <br> Line breaks. <br> These help separate sentences and paragraphs from each other. Otherwise. They will just. run. side. by. side.
<br></h1>
<h2>To make line breaks, just put 'br' in between words/sentences/paragraphs.</h2>

<h3>The next bit is shading. By putting in hr size="NUMBER" noshade you can create borders.</h3>

<hr size="5" noshade=>
<h3>This is what I mean. And you can increase the size of the border by increasing the number, or decreasing it for whatever reason. Right now it's at 5.</h3>
<hr size="5" noshade=>
<h3>For example: (50)</h3>
<hr size="50" noshade>
<h3>Or this: (150)</h3>
<hr size="150" noshade>

<h3>Next I've learned about boilerplating in coding language. Each website needs to have an opening, such as...
<br>
An opening: doctype html, followed by html lang="en" to specify the language being used. After that is the ... 
<br> 
 head, which is the information about the website that is not presented to the user. This includes the title, charset="UTF-8"
 <br>
 After that, the body is made, which includes text, images, etc etc. Don't forget to close everything you open.
</h3>

<h3>Next I learned how to add reference links. For more information on how to reach me, follow these links.</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_abdullahkhalaf_/">Instagram</a></li>
    <h3>OR</h3>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/abdullah.khalaf.5">Facebook</a> </li>
</ul>

<h3>I did this by opening a ul, and within that a li, then an a href="LINK", then what I want the user to see, then closing each bracket.</h3>

<h3>Other things I've learned include using <em>Italicised writing</em>, and <it>Italicised writing again ðŸ—¿.</it> Although, em is better to use instead of i because of reasons but i forget why. Another thing I learned is <strong>STRONK TEXT</strong> You can do this by using strong or b</h3>

<h3>I've also learned how to make this:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Unordered lists</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Ordered lists.</li>
</ol>
<h3>To make this I used ul and ol for ordered and unordered. Within each of these I put li for each thing I wanted to list.</h3>

<h3>For this photo I used img src="IMAGE LINK", and that's it. I can also download images and put them into the folder along with the source code. After that, i no longer need the iamge address and can just use the iamge file name isntead.</h3>
